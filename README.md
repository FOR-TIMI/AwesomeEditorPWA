## Purpose

With this text editor web application,

- when you open my application in the editor, you should see a client-server folder structure
- when you run `npm start` from the root directory you find that my application should start up the back end and serve the client
- when run the text editor application from my terminal, you find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
- when you run your webpack plugins, you find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
- when you use next-gen JavaScript in my application you find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
- when you open the text editor you find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
- when you enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window you find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
- when you reopen the text editor after closing it, you find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB database
- when you click on the Install button you download my web application as an icon on my desktop
- when you load the web application, you automatically register a service worker using workbox
- when you register a service worker, your static assets get precached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
- when you deploy to Heroku, you have the proper build scipts for a webpack application.
